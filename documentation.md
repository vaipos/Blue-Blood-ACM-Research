# Blue Blood Documentation

## Overview

The project aims to use machine-learning to predict post-treatment blood profiles based on pre-treatment reports and medications prescribed. The model uses CTGAN to fill the gap of producing synthetic data to help with the training and testing steps of the project. It also uses sdv to carry out the statistical analysis.
